/**

 *
 * An audio clip is defined as a file path and a begin and end point in
 * that file. measured in seconds. For example:
 *
 * { url: "audio/É‘.mp3"
 * , "clip": [2.450, 3.550]
 * }
 *
 * For any minimal pair, there will be two audio clips, for example: for
 * "staff" and for "stuff". Each of these will be stored in a separate
 * file, with a separate url. Switching from one recording to the other
 * will mean loading a different audio file.
